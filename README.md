# Legal AI Chatbot using LLM Fine Tuning

This repository presents an implementation of a Legal AI Chatbot that effectively answers legal queries by leveraging a fine-tuned large language model. The project utilizes the Mistral 7B Instruct v0.3 model fine-tuned on Indian legal textbooks, including the Constitution, using LoRA for efficient adaptation.

## Features

- **Fine-Tuned Legal Model**:
  - Fine-tuned Mistral 7B on a diverse range of Indian legal textbooks.
  - Tailored responses to legal queries based on extensive legal literature.

- **Efficient Fine-Tuning Technique**:
  - Utilizes LoRA for efficient fine-tuning.
  - Optimized for memory usage with model quantization.

- **Legal Query Resolution**:
  - Provides accurate and context-aware answers to legal queries.
  - Supports a wide spectrum of legal topics including constitutional law, criminal law, and more.

## Technologies Used

- **Hugging Face API**: API used for model hosting, fine-tuning, and inference.
- **Python**: Main programming language for model manipulation, evaluation scripts, and chatbot functionality.
- **Mistral 7B**: The base large language model fine-tuned specifically for legal text comprehension.
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: Technique applied to achieve efficient fine-tuning on resource-constrained setups.
